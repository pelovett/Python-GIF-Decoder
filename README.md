# Python-GIF-Decoder

As the title illuminates, this project is a GIF decoder written in python. The goal is to write a GIF decoder in one python file that will either return a matrix of tuples containing RGB values or display a file using the scipy module.

Currently the LZW decompression algorithm is being worked on.
